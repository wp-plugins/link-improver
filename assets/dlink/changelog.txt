|  ,/         \,   OK, so here's the changelog, I wouldn't   |
| ((__,-"""-,__))   expect to see much activity here cause   |
|  `--)~   ~(--`    -DLINK- is for all intensive purposes    |
| .-'(       )`-,   complete, but changes will be made if /  |
| `~~`d\   /b`~~`   when people report errors or problems    |
|     \     /       with the code! If you find any, email:   |
|     (6___6)                                                |

/#~************* -DLINK- 0.9.6 - 20th Dec 2008 ************~#\
|                                                            |
| * Added 3 variables that modify the behaviour of -DLINK-   |
|   for the people that find certain features conflict with  |
|   their website setup. When linking to the lib these       |
|   parameters can be added:                                 |
|    * dlink.js?notargets&notitles&nomailevents              |
|                                                            |
| * Added a few more icons / file-extensions too             |
|                                                            |

/#~************* -DLINK- 0.9.5 - 12th Dec 2008 ************~#\
|                                                            |
| * Seperated some of the functionality out so that you can  |
|   highlight new areas *after* init has been called. Just   |
|   pass DLINK.highlight an element and the rest is history! |
|                                                            |

/#~************* -DLINK- 0.9.4 - 20th Nov 2008 ************~#\
|                                                            |
| * Links with "no_link" in their class are now skipped so   |
|   that you can manually ignore individual links.           |
|                                                            |
| * Slight fix with the email notice - it just needed an     |
|   unescape running on it. I'll get round to making this    |
|   altogether more useful!                                  |
|                                                            |

/#~************* -DLINK- 0.9.3 - 5th Nov 2008 *************~#\
|                                                            |
| * Probably the final version for a long time.              |
|                                                            |
| * -DLINK- now only parses the parts of the document that   |
|   have been given the class of "dlink" so that you can     |
|   keep your carefully designed navigations and whatnot.    |
|                                                            |

|                                                            |
| * -DLINK- now detects 2 new link types: email and anchor   |
|   that it adds special icons for when needed.              |
|                                                            |
| * Email links have an extra layer of use added "onclick",  |
|   unobtrusive of course                                    |
|                                                            |

| * I have added favicon detection to any "web" type links   |
|   or links that it can't figure out.                       |
|                                                            |

| * First incarnation of -DLINK-, features:                  |
|   * Detects internal, external and subdomain links.        |
|   * Detects the file-extention and adds an icon.           |
|   * Adds target="_blank" to external links that need it.   |
|                                                            |
| * I intend to merge the code I use for adding favicons to  |
|   my links soon for extra functionality.                   |
|                                                            |
